## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is widely used for building scalable network applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

### Key Features of Node.js:
- **JavaScript Everywhere**: Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side applications, making full-stack development more streamlined.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Node.js operates on an event-driven, asynchronous model, which is ideal for real-time applications that require high performance, such as chat apps, games, and live streaming.
- **Single-Threaded but Scalable**: Although Node.js is single-threaded, it can handle multiple connections simultaneously by offloading tasks to the operating system, making it highly efficient and scalable.
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Node.js includes npm, the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries, which allows developers to easily share and reuse code across projects.

Node.js is widely adopted for building fast and scalable server-side applications, making it a popular choice among developers and companies for creating a variety of applications.
